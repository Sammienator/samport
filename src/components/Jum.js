          environments, and an individual who aspires to achieve both organisational and personal goals
          that may be presented to me. I have just over  2 and a half years of
          experience as a junior software developer . As a self taught developer, I
          have contributed to over a dozen projects and repositories through out career. I have attended multiple 
          BOOTcamps and internships such as GOOGLE Africa Developer scholarship (GADS) Andela Community among others, and this is where I was able to hone and refine my developer skills .</p>
